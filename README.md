## üåç Industry Insights

Retail and e-commerce industries rely heavily on agile analytics to make timely decisions on inventory, pricing, and promotions. A well-structured dashboard can surface hidden trends, customer behavior, and financial inefficiencies. From this dashboard, users can quickly:

- Identify **underperforming categories or regions**
- Detect **profit margin fluctuations** across segments
- Compare **seasonal trends** to forecast future demand
- Track **sales velocity and inventory movement**

These insights directly support **strategic planning, procurement, and sales optimization** across retail chains and stores.


## üíº Real-World Business Application

   - **Question:** Which regions are generating the lowest sales despite high inventory?
   - **Solution:** Use the Region filter + Sales & Quantity metrics to detect low sales-to-stock ratio. Adjust procurement or run targeted promotions.

### 2. **Problem: Decreasing Profit Margins Despite High Sales**
   - **Question:** Which categories or segments have high sales but declining profits?
   - **Solution:** Compare Sales and Profit KPIs across Categories using slicers. Spot inefficiencies or pricing issues.

### 3. **Problem: Identifying High-Value Customer Segments**
   - **Question:** Which customer segments drive the most profit?
   - **Solution:** Use Segment slicer to compare Profit metrics. Helps in focusing marketing and retention efforts.

### 4. **Problem: Seasonal Demand Forecasting**
